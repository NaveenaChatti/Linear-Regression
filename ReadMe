# Multiple Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in the Delhi region using multiple linear regression. The objective is to identify key factors influencing property prices and build an interpretable model that accurately estimates prices based on these features.

## Problem Statement
A real estate company wants to optimize property prices by analyzing variables such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and other factors. The goal is to build a regression model that quantitatively relates these variables to house prices and assess the model’s predictive accuracy.

## Data
The dataset contains 545 entries with 13 features including numerical variables (e.g., area, bedrooms, bathrooms) and categorical variables (e.g., mainroad, guestroom, furnishing status).

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization
- Inspected dataset size, data types, and summary statistics.
- Visualized relationships using pairplots and boxplots for numerical and categorical features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical variables with "yes/no" values into binary (1/0).
- Created dummy variables for multi-level categorical features such as furnishing status.

### 3. Data Splitting and Scaling
- Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
- Scaled numerical features using Min-Max scaling for comparability.

### 4. Model Building
- Started with simple linear regression on area.
- Incrementally added variables (bathrooms, bedrooms, stories, etc.) to improve model performance.
- Evaluated statistical significance using p-values and multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
- Dropped insignificant and highly collinear variables iteratively.

### 5. Final Model and Evaluation
- Final model includes 10 predictors with acceptable p-values and VIFs.
- Achieved an adjusted R-squared of ~0.67, indicating good explanatory power.
- Residuals checked for normality.
- Predicted house prices on the test set and compared actual vs predicted values.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset `Housing.csv`.
2. Run the notebook/script sequentially to preprocess, build, and evaluate the model.
3. Modify features or model parameters as needed for experimentation.

## Insights
- Area, bathrooms, stories, and air conditioning have significant positive influence on price.
- Some features like bedrooms and semi-furnished status were dropped due to insignificance or multicollinearity.
- Model can be further improved by feature engineering or using non-linear regression techniques.
- The model explains about 67% of the variance in housing prices, but a notable portion of price variation is influenced by factors like location and neighborhood characteristics, which are not captured in the dataset. Incorporating such variables could further improve the model’s accuracy.”
