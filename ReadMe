Multiple Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts housing prices in the Delhi region using Multiple Linear Regression.
The goal is to identify key factors influencing prices and build an interpretable, data-driven model that can estimate prices based on property features.

🎯 Problem Statement
A real estate company wants to optimize property pricing by analyzing features such as area, bathrooms, parking, and amenities.
The aim is to:

Quantitatively relate these features to housing prices.

Build a model with high explanatory power and practical interpretability.

📊 Dataset
Rows: 545

Features: 13 (6 numerical, 7 categorical)

Example features:

Numerical → area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking

Categorical → mainroad, guestroom, basement, furnishingstatus

🛠 Steps Undertaken
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Visualization
Checked dataset size, data types, and summary statistics.

Used pairplots and boxplots to understand feature–price relationships.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Converted Yes/No features to binary (1/0).

Created dummy variables for multi-category features (e.g., furnishingstatus).

3️⃣ Data Splitting & Scaling
Split data into 70% training and 30% testing.

Applied Min–Max scaling to numerical variables for comparability.

4️⃣ Model Building
Started with a simple regression on area.

Incrementally added significant features (bathrooms, stories, etc.).

Checked p-values (statistical significance) and VIF (multicollinearity).

Dropped insignificant/highly correlated variables (e.g., bedrooms, semi-furnished).

5️⃣ Final Model & Evaluation
Final model includes 10 predictors with acceptable p-values & VIF.

Adjusted R²: ~0.67 → explains 67% of price variation.

Residuals are normally distributed (satisfying regression assumptions).

Tested on unseen data → predictions align well with actual prices.

📈 Key Insights
Positive impact on price: Larger area, more bathrooms, additional stories, and having airconditioning.

Dropped features: bedrooms & semi-furnished due to insignificance/multicollinearity.

Limitation: Model doesn’t capture location/neighborhood effects, which likely explain much of the remaining variation in prices.

🚀 Future Improvements
Add location-based features (zip codes, neighborhood quality).

Experiment with non-linear models or interaction terms.

Feature engineering to capture hidden patterns.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels
